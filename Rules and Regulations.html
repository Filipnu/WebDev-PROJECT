    <h2>𝙲𝚊𝚝 𝙰𝚍𝚘𝚙𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗 𝙶𝚞𝚒𝚍𝚎𝚕𝚒𝚗𝚎𝚜</h2>
    <p>Thank you for considering adopting one of our cats! We’re excited to help you find your new furry friend. <br> Please read and agree to the following rules to ensure a safe, happy home for your new companion.</p>

    <h2>𝚁𝚞𝚕𝚎𝚜 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚁𝚎𝚐𝚞𝚕𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>You must be at least 18 years old to adopt a cat. Cats are adorable, but they need responsible humans!</li>
      <li>Your adopted cat must live indoors at all times. Cats are safer, healthier, and happier when they stay inside where they belong.</li>
      <li>All adopters must provide a valid ID and proof of residence (e.g., a utility bill or lease agreement). This helps us ensure that you’re ready for your new family member.</li>
      <li>A home inspection may be required before we finalize the adoption. We just want to make sure your space is safe and cat-friendly!</li>
      <li>Your adopted cat is a lifelong companion, not a temporary guest. The cat cannot be sold, given away, or transferred to another person without notifying us. We’re here to help if anything changes</li>
      <li>If you can no longer care for your cat for any reason, please return them to us. No judgment we just want them to be safe and loved.</li>
      <li>Adopting a cat means making a lifelong commitment to their health, happiness, and well-being. Cats can live 15 more years, so be ready to provide love, care, and companionship throughout their entire life.</li>
    </ol>
